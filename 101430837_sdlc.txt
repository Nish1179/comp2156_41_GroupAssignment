DevOps, short for Development and Operations, is a software engineering methodology that focuses on integrating the work of development teams and operations to improve the flow and value delivery of applications.
Key principles of DevOps include automation of the software development lifecycle, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), deployment management, and monitoring. By adopting a DevOps strategy, businesses can increase operational efficiencies, deliver products faster, reduce security risks, and enhance collaboration between development and operations team.
DevOps is not just a methodology but also a cultural shift that promotes better communication and collaboration between different teams involved in software development. It aims to align people, processes, and tools towards a unified customer focus. Successful DevOps implementation leads to faster time-to-market for software, improved software quality, enhanced collaboration between teams, increased efficiency through automation, and streamlined development processes
